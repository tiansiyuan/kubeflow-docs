Overview
--------

A typical Machine Learning (ML) workflow consists of three stages: preprocessing, training, and serving. During preprocessing, 
data cleaning and data transformations are performed. During the training stage, one or more models are trained. These models 
are in turn made available to the target audience in the serving stage. The data generated during serving can be fed back to 
the pipeline to help improve model accuracy, keep the model relevant and up-to-date as old training data might become 
irrelevant. The increasing amount of data available as input for ML workflows increases the need for efficient processing of 
data. And therefore it would be useful for us learn how to integrate Apache Spark into Kubeflow ML workflow.

Using bigger machines to process large amount of data is expensive and sometimes not possible anymore. Hence, the available 
solution today is distributed computing. `Apache Spark <https://spark.apache.org/>`__ is a distributed computation framework. 
It is used widely for data-intensive processing tasks. It is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data 
science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters. It supports multiple powerful features such as streaming 
data, SQL analytics, data science at scale and machine learning. 

In this guide, we will walk you through an example to show how to integrate Spark into Kubeflow ML workflow.

-------------
Prerequisites
-------------

Make sure following prerequisites are fulfilled before starting this experiment:

* Familiar with :ref:`kubeflow_pipelines`
* Install ``helm`` CLI following `official documentations <https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/>`__

----------------------
Install Spark operator
----------------------

We start from installing Spark operator on Kubernetes cluster. In your terminal, run following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    helm repo add spark-operator https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/spark-on-k8s-operator

    [microk8s] kubectl config view --raw > ~/.kube/config

    helm install my-release spark-operator/spark-operator --namespace kubeflow

To confirm your Spark operator is on, run ``[microk8s] kubectl get pods -n kubeflow``, and you should see pods with name such 
as ``spark-operator-0`` in "Running" status.

------------------------------------------------
Create Spark Service Account and add permissions
------------------------------------------------

In this example, we will create a service account called ``spark-sa`` to run the ML pipeline with Spark job.

First create the YAML file for the service account. In your VM, create following YAML file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ServiceAccount
    metadata:
      name: spark-sa
      namespace: kubeflow
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Role
    metadata:
      namespace: kubeflow
      name: spark-role
    rules:
    - apiGroups: [""]
      resources: ["pods", "services", "configmaps", "pods/log"]
      verbs: ["create", "get", "watch", "list", "post", "delete", "patch"]
    - apiGroups: ["sparkoperator.k8s.io"]
      resources: ["sparkapplications"]
      verbs: ["create", "get", "watch", "list", "post", "delete", "patch"]
    ---
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: RoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: spark-role-binding
      namespace: kubeflow
    subjects:
    - kind: ServiceAccount
      name: spark-sa
      namespace: kubeflow
    roleRef:
      kind: Role
      name: spark-role
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

.. note::
    In this example, we create the service account under ``admin`` namespace. You may change that based on your own situation 
    and need.

We then apply the YAML file to create the ``spark-sa`` service account using following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    [microk8s] kubectl apply -f <create_service_account_yaml_file>

------------------------------------
Create the pipeline with a Spark job
------------------------------------

Now, it's time to get started with concreate coding work to create a pipeline with a Spark job.

.. _workflow overview:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Workflow Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The main challage here is to orchestrate a Spark job from Kubeflow and submit it to the cluster. We will solve this by using 
pipeline components for kubernetes. 

We will create a *k8s apply component* to load the Spark job manifest file and perform ``kubectl apply`` to submit it to the 
cluster. In this way, a ``sparkapplication`` resource would be created in the cluster.

We will also need to create a *k8s get component* to periodically poll the *control plane* to get the status of the Spark job. 
And once the job is in "COMPLETED" state, the pipeline will move to the next step.

The overall workflow of Spark job in Kubeflow pipeline is shown in below figure.

    .. image:: ../_static/user-guide-spark-overview.jpg

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Import packages and define global variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On your Kubeflow web UI, connect to a Notebook Server, and create a notebook (i.e., ``.ipynb`` file).

In the notebook, first mport packages and define global variables needed for this example.

.. code-block:: python

    import json
    import time
    import yaml

    import kfp.components as comp
    import kfp.dsl as dsl

    SPARK_COMPLETED_STATE = "COMPLETED"
    SPARK_APPLICATION_KIND = "sparkapplications"

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Define Spark job application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example, we will create a simple Spark job that calculates an approximate value of Pi(π). Below is the YAML file.

We will name it ``spark-job-python.yaml``. And we suggest you put it under the same path with your notebook.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: spark-job-python.yaml

    apiVersion: "sparkoperator.k8s.io/v1beta2"
    kind: SparkApplication
    metadata:
      name: pyspark-pi-{epoch}
      namespace: admin
    spec:
      type: Python
      pythonVersion: "3"
      mode: cluster
      image: "gcr.io/spark-operator/spark-py:v3.1.1"
      imagePullPolicy: Always
      mainApplicationFile: local:///opt/spark/examples/src/main/python/pi.py
      sparkVersion: "3.1.1"
      restartPolicy:
        type: OnFailure
        onFailureRetries: 3
        onFailureRetryInterval: 10
        onSubmissionFailureRetries: 5
        onSubmissionFailureRetryInterval: 20
      driver:
        cores: 1
        coreLimit: "1200m"
        memory: "512m"
        labels:
          version: 3.1.1
        serviceAccount: spark-sa
      executor:
        cores: 1
        instances: 1
        memory: "512m"
        labels:
          version: 3.1.1

We then define following function to get the Spark job definition in the notebook. It reads the Spark Operator job manifest file and returns 
the corresponding dictionary and add some randomness in the job name. 

**Note:** If you name your Spark job definition YAML file differently, remember to change the ``spark-job-python.yaml`` to your own.

.. code-block:: python

    def get_spark_job_definition():
        # Read manifest file
        with open("spark-job-python.yaml", "r") as stream:
            spark_job_manifest = yaml.safe_load(stream)

        # Add epoch time in the job name
        epoch = int(time.time())
        spark_job_manifest["metadata"]["name"] = spark_job_manifest["metadata"]["name"].format(epoch=epoch)

        return spark_job_manifest

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Apply the Spark job manifest file and create the job
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As explained in :ref:`workflow overview`, our next step is to use *k8s apply component* to load the Spark job manifest file 
and create the corresponding ``sparkapplication`` resource in the cluster.

Define the *k8s apply component* using following YAML file. We will name it ``k8s-apply-component.yaml``. And we suggest you put it under the same path with your notebook.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: k8s-apply-component.yaml

    name: Apply Kubernetes object
    inputs:
      - {name: Object, type: JsonObject}
    outputs:
      - {name: Name, type: String}
      - {name: Kind, type: String}
      - {name: Object, type: JsonObject}
    metadata:
      annotations:
        author: Alexey Volkov <alexey.volkov@ark-kun.com>
    implementation:
      container:
        image: bitnami/kubectl:1.17.17
        command:
          - bash
          - -exc
          - |
            object_path=$0
            output_name_path=$1
            output_kind_path=$2
            output_object_path=$3
            mkdir -p "$(dirname "$output_name_path")"
            mkdir -p "$(dirname "$output_kind_path")"
            mkdir -p "$(dirname "$output_object_path")"
            kubectl apply -f "$object_path" --output=json > "$output_object_path"
            < "$output_object_path" jq '.metadata.name' --raw-output > "$output_name_path"
            < "$output_object_path" jq '.kind' --raw-output > "$output_kind_path"
          - {inputPath: Object}
          - {outputPath: Name}
          - {outputPath: Kind}
          - {outputPath: Object}

We will use this file in later :ref:`define pipeline` step.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Monitor the Spark job status
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned in :ref:`workflow overview`, after the ``apply`` operation, the execution engine has to wait for the job to complete 
before moving on to the next pipeline step. We will define a *k8s get component* to periodically get the application’s state 
and it will iterate until the job achieves "COMPLETED" state.

The iteration would be done using recursion and the ``dsl.Condition`` instruction, and we will use ``@graph_component`` decorator 
to indicate the recursive execution for the function.

The *k8s get component* is defined using following YAML file. We will name it ``k8s-get-component.yaml``. And we suggest you put it under the same path with your notebook.

.. code-block:: yaml
    :caption: k8s-get-component.yaml

    name: Get Kubernetes object
    inputs:
      - {name: Name, type: String}
      - {name: Kind, type: String}
    outputs:
      - {name: Name, type: String}
      - {name: ApplicationState, type: String}
      - {name: Object, type: JsonObject}
    metadata:
      annotations:
        author: Alexey Volkov <alexey.volkov@ark-kun.com>
    implementation:
      container:
        image: bitnami/kubectl:1.17.17
        command:
          - bash
          - -exc
          - |
            object_name=$0
            object_type=$1
            output_name_path=$2
            output_state_path=$3
            output_object_path=$4
            mkdir -p "$(dirname "$output_name_path")"
            mkdir -p "$(dirname "$output_state_path")"
            mkdir -p "$(dirname "$output_object_path")"
            kubectl get "$object_type" "$object_name" --output=json > "$output_object_path"
            < "$output_object_path" jq '.metadata.name' --raw-output > "$output_name_path"
            < "$output_object_path" jq '.status.applicationState.state' --raw-output > "$output_state_path"
          - {inputValue: Name}
          - {inputValue: Kind}
          - {outputPath: Name}
          - {outputPath: ApplicationState}
          - {outputPath: Object}

Above get component executions are defined in following function in the notebook.

**Note:** If you name your get component YAML file differently, remember to change the ``k8s-get-component.yaml`` to your own.

.. code-block:: python

    @dsl.graph_component
    def graph_component_spark_app_status(input_application_name):
        k8s_get_op = comp.load_component_from_file("k8s-get-component.yaml")
        check_spark_application_status_op = k8s_get_op(
            name=input_application_name,
            kind=SPARK_APPLICATION_KIND
        )
        # Remove cache
        check_spark_application_status_op.execution_options.caching_strategy.max_cache_staleness = "P0D"

        time.sleep(5)
        with dsl.Condition(check_spark_application_status_op.outputs["applicationstate"] != SPARK_COMPLETED_STATE):
            graph_component_spark_app_status(check_spark_application_status_op.outputs["name"])

Once the Spark application is completed, the execution will carry on with other pipeline steps.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Define print messages function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before defining our final pipeline, we spend some time defining following function to print messages in the notebook.

.. code-block:: python

    def print_op(msg):
        return dsl.ContainerOp(
            name="Print message.",
            image="alpine:3.6",
            command=["echo", msg],
        )

.. _define pipeline:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Define the pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We can now define our final pipeline using above functions in the notebook.

**Note:** If you name your apply component YAML file differently, remember to change the ``k8s-apply-component.yaml`` to your own.


.. code-block:: python

    @dsl.pipeline(
        name="Spark Operator job pipeline",
        description="Spark Operator job pipeline"
    )
    def spark_job_pipeline():

        # Load spark job manifest
        spark_job_definition = get_spark_job_definition()

        # Load the kubernetes apply component
        k8s_apply_op = comp.load_component_from_file("k8s-apply-component.yaml")

        # Execute the apply command
        spark_job_op = k8s_apply_op(object=json.dumps(spark_job_definition))

        # Fetch spark job name
        spark_job_name = spark_job_op.outputs["name"]

        # Remove cache for the apply operator
        spark_job_op.execution_options.caching_strategy.max_cache_staleness = "P0D"

        spark_application_status_op = graph_component_spark_app_status(spark_job_op.outputs["name"])
        spark_application_status_op.after(spark_job_op)

        print_message = print_op(f"Job {spark_job_name} is completed.")
        print_message.after(spark_application_status_op)
        print_message.execution_options.caching_strategy.max_cache_staleness = "P0D"

.. _compile pipeline:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Compile the pipeline
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, we compile the pipeline using following codes in the notebook:

.. code-block:: python

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        # Compile the pipeline
        import kfp.compiler as compiler
        import logging
        logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
        pipeline_func = spark_job_pipeline
        pipeline_filename = pipeline_func.__name__ + ".yaml"
        compiler.Compiler().compile(pipeline_func, pipeline_filename)
        logging.info(f"Generated pipeline file: {pipeline_filename}.")

-----------------------------------------
Create, execute, and inspect the pipeline
-----------------------------------------

.. note::
    Details and screenshots of how to create pipelines from YAML file and how to create experiments and runs are included in 
    :ref:`kubeflow_pipelines`. 

After :ref:`compile pipeline`, you should see the YAML file of your pipeline generated in the corresponding directory.

    .. image:: ../_static/user-guide-spark-seePipelineYAML.png

Download the YAML file. And create the pipeline using this YAML file. 

The pipeline should be like following:

    .. image:: ../_static/user-guide-spark-pipeline.png

Create an experiment for this pipeline, and then create a run. Remember to set the Service Account as ``spark-sa``. 

    .. image:: ../_static/user-guide-spark-serviceAccount.png

Start the pipeline run, and wait for the pipeline to finish. A successful pipeline run should look like below:

    .. image:: ../_static/user-guide-spark-success.png

Feel free to click on each pipeline step to see the component running details.
